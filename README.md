An Ethereum-Based Blockchain Task List

## Introduction

Welcome to my first attempt at creating an Ethereum-based DApp ([Decentralized App](http://blockchainhub.net/decentralized-applications-dapps/))
. This application involved learning to connect an 
Ethereum wallet (primarily MetaMask), and then performing basic transactions. 
It was written in basic HTML, JavaScript, and Solidity, though in the future 
I hope to create DApps which implement the React framework. It also implements [lite-server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server) as a quick development server tool.

Learning to create this DApp was an extremely exciting and interesting first-foray into Blockchain development, 
and I am extremely excited to continue learning more and developing more intricate and complicated DApps and other Blockchain solutions.

Feel free to connect with me on any of the following social media links 
if you have any questions or suggestions on what I can learn next!

## Usage Instructions

This Task List DApp is designed to be used in a ***Development-Mode Only*** due to its use of lite-server. Additionally, this DApp
has been designed to mainly utilize [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) as its primary Ethereum gateway/interface.
Please make sure to follow these next basic guidelines in order to have the best experience possible.

1. Clone this Repository
2. Run an NPM install from the root your new cloned project directory
3. Install a personal Ethereum Blockchain, such as Ganache
4. Make sure your personal Ethereum Blockchain is running (in this case, Ganache)
5. Run *npm run dev* in your development terminal
6. Have the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extension installed and enabled on your browser
7. Set up your personal Etherium Blockchain as an additional network in MetaMask
8. Add one of your local personal wallets to MetaMask
9. Enjoy testing the DApp!
